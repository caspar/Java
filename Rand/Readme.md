WHAT IT DOES:
Returns the probability of, in an array of "length" numbers in range "range", 3 identical consecutive numbers occuring.

HOW TO USE IT:
After compiling, type "java Rand", followed by the parameters "length", "range", and "trials"; seperated by a space. 
Obviously, a larger number of trials will yield more accurate results.
